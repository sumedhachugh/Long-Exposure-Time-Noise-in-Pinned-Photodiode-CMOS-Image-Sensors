# Long-Exposure-Time-Noise-in-Pinned-Photodiode-CMOS-Image-Sensors

 In this presentation we focussed on:
• A new noise source (Long Exposure Time Noise) within a pinned photodiode in
CMOS image sensors.
• The cause of this noise source: Feedforward effect
• TCAD simulations using the Monte Carlo method showing how the barrier height varies with CMOS process
• How to improve the long exposure time noise performance of the device.
